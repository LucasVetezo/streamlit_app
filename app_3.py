# Title of the app
st.title("Research on Linear Hydraulic Fracture Propagation")

# Introduction
st.header("Overview")
st.write("""
This research focuses on understanding the propagation of linear hydraulic fractures in subsurface environments. 
Hydraulic fracturing is a critical process in enhancing the extraction of oil, gas, and geothermal energy. 
The study investigates the factors influencing fracture growth, such as fluid pressure, rock properties, and stress fields.
""")

# Key Findings
st.header("Key Findings")
st.write("""
1. **Fracture Length and Width**: The fracture length increases with higher fluid injection rates, while the width is influenced by the rock's elastic properties.
2. **Pressure Distribution**: The pressure distribution within the fracture is non-uniform, with higher pressures near the injection point.
3. **Stress Anisotropy**: The orientation of the fracture is strongly influenced by the in-situ stress anisotropy.
4. **Fluid Viscosity**: Higher fluid viscosity leads to slower fracture propagation but results in wider fractures.
""")

# Trends and Results
st.header("Trends and Results")
st.write("""
The following trends were observed from the research:
- **Fracture Propagation Rate**: The rate of fracture propagation is proportional to the square root of the injection rate.
- **Rock Brittleness**: Brittle rocks tend to produce longer and narrower fractures compared to ductile rocks.
- **Environmental Impact**: The study highlights the importance of minimizing fluid leakage to reduce environmental risks.
